Place desktop icons evenly to any monitor

This project was started when a new 4K monitor on the right caused icons on 2K monitor on the left to be placed down left column and then disappear. To fix this problem it was necessary to place icons based on monitor and not virtual screen dimensions. In the process I added a feature to place icons on any monitor (up to 3 currently supported).

## iconic Main Menu

The main menu allows you to save and load desktop icon settings. The main menu leads you to additional windows to sort icons and manage monitors. Also you can apply new settings.

## iconic Sort Icons

You can sort icons alphabetically, or alphabetically by removing "Link to" from sort order. You can sort by date in ascending or descending order. After sorting you can reposition an individual icon to a higher or lower position.

## iconic Monitors Notebook

The notebook provides multiple tabs for accessing Monitors General settings and a tab for each individual monitor.

The General settings tab allows you to set the monitor where desktop icons are placed. Additionally global definition of reserved space on left, top, right and bottom of monitors where icons should not go. Do this to allow space for window manager launchers and application indicator bars.

On this notebook tab you can also specify the number of seconds a test will last. Press the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to place icons on the Desktop using currently defined settings for number or columns, rows and reserved screen space.

Assign a user friendly name to each monitor. Set the number of rows and columnss to utilize for icon placement on each monitor.
